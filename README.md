## Overview

This project is designed to help users train a machine learning model and evaluate its performance using provided datasets. The notebooks are structured with clear step-by-step instructions for loading data, training the model, and testing its performance.

---

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/amanagr1804/indiaai-cybergaurd.git
   cd indiaai-cybergaurd
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Python installed and set up a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   *(Note: Create a `requirements.txt` file listing all necessary libraries if not already included.)*

## Usage

### 1. Training the Model

- Open the `Train.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab:
  ```bash
  jupyter notebook Train.ipynb
  ```
- Follow the instructions in the notebook to load your dataset, configure training parameters, and train the model.
- Ensure you have provided the required dataset in the correct format (update the notebook with file paths if necessary).

### 2. Testing the Model

- Open the `Test.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab:
  ```bash
  jupyter notebook Test.ipynb
  ```
- Follow the instructions in the notebook to load the trained model and evaluate its performance on the test dataset.

### 3. Inference the Model

- Open the `Inference.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab:
- There is a pretrained model with https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1GrZgtbCe8lxjSaSzKDo95CNm6lInXpRt?usp=drive_link
  ```bash
  pip install gdown
  gdown --folder https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1GrZgtbCe8lxjSaSzKDo95CNm6lInXpRt
  unzip folder_name.zip
  ```
- Follow the instructions in the notebook to load the trained model and evaluate its performance on any text.

---

## Dependencies

The notebooks rely on the following libraries (add or update as needed):
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- TensorFlow or PyTorch (if applicable)

Install the dependencies using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## File Descriptions

- **`Train.ipynb`**: Contains the code and instructions to train the machine learning model. Modify the dataset path and model parameters as per your requirements.
- **`Test.ipynb`**: Contains the code and instructions to test the trained model. Ensure the model file generated in `Train.ipynb` is available for evaluation.
